# Module


￼
## Introduction

- reusable function to run later
- in own "space" in medium where code is stored, e.g. string, file, clipboard, URL, etc.
- beware: not necessarily file ❗️
- space has hierarchy, like routes in a file-based router, can have multiple modules per space, like multiple routes per path-level
- has its own scope, closing over outer scope
- beware: outer scope not necessarily from parent module, a module can contain multiple nested scopes, e.g. block, object, etc. ❗️
- automatically imported in parent module, identifier from name of "space", e.g. identifier is file name
- i.e. to create function in current module creates a sub-space, e.g. file in subfolder, nested URL, etc.
- i.e. current module has all functions in scope, just like in traditional language where declares functions in same file
- beware: IDE needs to support spaces, not only files, make easy to create new space ❗️
- beware: no lambda, every running-later-function is a module ❗️
- no global scope, only modules, must explicitly pass arguments
- root module has no input, output is not used, by convention return `None` output
- for calling see Function



## Body

- top level is function body, no syntax needed
- async by default, make parallel programs easier not harder
- can opt-in to sync instead
- in body can only call sync functions

```
sync &{

}
```

<!-- todo: fix remove syntax for sync function body in top level -->



## Input

- single argument `in` built-in immutable variable
- for multiple inputs pass object
- can assign (properties of) `in` to variable(s) or use directly
- no order on arguments as multiple only using object, can pass any subset or superset, missing values are set to `None`, unused values are ignored, like in JavaScript
<!-- todo: good idea to allow sub-/superset with loose coupling -->
- convention to declare variables at beginning, but not necessary
<!-- todo: to find accepted arguments parser needs to find all mentions of `in` and catalog the extracted variables, how to check if constructs object earlier into variable and passes variable, too difficult? -->
<!-- todo: mandatory / optional arguments -->
- IDE is encouraged to show summary on hover over function name like argument names and types, return type
- can use default value using boolean comparison, no new syntax
- since strongly typed no empty values, no default values necessary
- no optional parameters, needs to pass all arguments
<!-- todo: variadic arguments, rest parameters? for arbitrarily many parameters, e.g. add, join, etc.
what would parameter become? List, object?
can use multiple, matches greedily (longest possible match), like in TypeScript variadic tuple types?
-->
- allows overload of same name with another function with arguments of different types
<!-- todo: good idea? -->
- beware: types of at least one argument must be disjoint (can't be superset of other), otherwise compiler would have multiple choices...
<!-- todo: enough to guarantee that choices for compiler are unambiguous? -->



## Output

- return value is last value like in Rust, defaults to `None`
- optionally can assign to built-in `out` variable to return earlier, e.g. in a branch
- returns on first assignment to `out`
- if wants multiple outputs return object

```
in is name
if name {
  "Hello {name}!" is out
}
"Hello stranger!"
```

```js
name => {
  if (name) {
    return `Hello ${name}!`
  }
  return "Hello stranger!" 
}
```

- if single output can use automatically return of last expression

```￼
"Hello {name}!"
```

- beware: if doesn't return anything needs to put `None` at bottom, since implicitly returns last value ❗️



## Import

- load remote module, e.g. from network
- can then use as if it were local
- built-in async loading functions for different remote spaces, returns module, assign identifier to use, own  identifier to avoid namespace conflicts
- convention at beginning but can be anywhere, e.g. conditional import

```
"matrix://src/hello" to import_URL is hello
```

- beware: import itself can't have side effects since whole module is function body ❗️
- beware: if doesn't assign return value of loading function call to variable then can't use import ❗️
- beware: implementation detail to pre-load modules before running code, shouldn't influence language, e.g. pre-parse source code to find imports, figure out which imports are used (e.g. conditional imports), could either load every import and discard unused or load less and load additional later, etc. ❗️



## Default imports

<!-- todo: what is imported by default? e.g. built-in data type objects?
how is it determined? e.g. via a config, via version number? -->
