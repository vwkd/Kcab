# Function



## Introduction

- unit program, transforms inputs to outputs
- can run later as reusable or run now as single use
- has own scope
- expression, can be assigned to variable, given as argument to other functions, first-class, etc.
- tail call optimisation
- input like output is single value
- control flow construct, e.g. like conditional, loop (here identical), block (here identical), etc.
- beware: not a data type ❗️
- beware: completely different from object, unlike JavaScript where functions can have properties, and objects can be called ❗️
- beware: a function and object couldn't be identical, otherwise modifying the properties before calling it would result in different behavior since the variables in the scope would have changed ❗️



## Declaration

- see Module



## Calling

- operator `to`, like pointing the reader to the place where needs to continue reading
- pass-by-value, like Rust
- with arguments

```
myvar to hello
```

```js
hello(myvar)
```

```
"Jupiter" to hello
```

```js
hello("Jupiter")
```

- IDE is encouraged to autocomplete argument names in object
- chained calls not nested if doesn't need to chain into object properties

```
"Jupiter" to uppercase to hello
```

```js
hello(uppercase("Jupiter"))
```

- grouped due to object, no need for grouping operator 
- without arguments
<!-- todo: pass `None` explicitly `None to hello`? -->

```
to hello
```

```js
hello()
```

- strongly typed, object must match input type, no missing properties
- awaits by default, i.e. no forgotten `await` in variable assignment, etc.
- built-in helper methods that call multiple async functions in parallel, e.g. all, any, etc.

```
5 to timeout
```

- can skip using `forget` keyword
- skipping prevents any use, promise is not exposed, can't await promise later, i.e. can't assign to variable, pass as function argument, etc.

```
5 to timeout forget
```



## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

- single-use function to run now, called once at declaration
- can access parent scope, unlike module
- anonymous since never assigned to variable

```
"Jupiter" to {
  in is name
  "Hello {name}!"
}
```

```js
((name) => {
  return `Hello ${name}!`
})("Jupiter")
```

- shorthand for no arguments to leave of `to`
- also called "block"

```
{
  "Hello World!"
}
```

- can do recursion since has self

```
1 to {
  in is i
  if i ?< 10 {
    i to print
    i + 1 to self
  }
}
```

```js
// beware: can't do recursion with anonymous function expression since no identifier, approximate using function declaration
(function loop(i) {
  if (i < 10) {
    console.log(i)
    loop(i + 1)
  }
})(1)
```




## Loop

- none, use tail recursive function instead
- an expression
- gives all benefits of functions
- can do any loop that wants, e.g. loop on multiple arguments simultaneously, condition check at beginning, etc.
- no separate syntax

```
// "loop" sub-module
in is i
if i ?< 10 {
  i to print
  i + 1 to self
}

// parent-module
1 to loop
// 1, 2, ..., 9
```

```js
function loop(i) {
  if (i < 10) {
    console.log(i)
    loop(i + 1)
  }
}

loop(1);
// 1, 2, ..., 9

for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 1) {
  console.log(i)
}
// 1, 2, ..., 9

let i = 1
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i)
  i += 1
}
// 1, 2, ..., 9
```

- can do condition check at end

```js
function loop(i) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i < 10) {
    loop(i + 1)
  }
}

loop(1);
// 1, 2, ..., 10

// no such for loop or while loop that checks condition at end before increment
// can use do...while but increment comes before condition check
// therefore do check at beginning for previous iteration and start with one less

let i = 0;
do {
  i += 1
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 10)
// 1, 2, ..., 10
```

- can "continue" and "break" using if condition
