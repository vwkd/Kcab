# Conditional



## Introduction

- branches in code flow
- executes expression on condition
- expression



## Boolean

- condition is boolean
- can use any expressions, e.g. variable assignment, function call, etc.
<!-- todo: conditional variable declaration, accessing may break?! -->
- expression usually block
- beware: block must start in same line as keyword ❗️

```
maybe bool {

}
```

```rust
if bool {

}
```

- can make exhaustive using shorter `if`, must give alternative

```
if bool {

} else {

}
```

```rust
if bool {

} else {

}
```

- can chain, i.e. first condition that is true
- syntax such that second condition is like a new condition in the alternative

```
if bool1 {

} else if bool2 {

} else {

}
```

```rust
if bool1 {

} else if bool2 {

} else {

}
```

- can use like ternary operator in JS, but has own scope

```
if isDay { "Good morning" } else { "Good night" } is greeting
```

```js
const greeting = isDay ? "Good morning" : "Good night"
```



## Value

- condition is some value
- first value that matches
- values must be of same type

```
maybe value a val1 {

} a val2 {

}
```

- can make exhaustive using shorter `if`, must match some

```
if value a val1 {

} a val2 {

} else {

}
```

```rust
match value {
  val1 => {

  }
  val2 => {

  }
  else => {

  }
}
```

<!-- todo: specify condition on match arm as well? mixes boolean with value, just use exhaustive boolean instead? -->
