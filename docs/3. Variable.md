# Variable



## Introduction

- identifier for value within a scope
- lexical / static scope, not dynamic
- static type, not dynamic
- no global scope



## Declaration

- no syntax, like in Python
- name by convention lower_snake_case
- mutable without initialization, e.g. in outer scope, initialize later in inner scope

```
n mutable
```

```js
let n
```

- beware: error if accessed before initialization ❗️
- mutable with initialization

```
5 is n mutable
```

```js
let n = 5
```

- immutable with initialization, default similar to Rust
- beware: no immutable without initialization, as would have no value ❗️

```
6 is m
```

```js
const m = 6
```

- no hoisting
- repeated declaration in same scope is error, can shadow in child scope
- expression, e.g. can declare yet another variable

```
5 is n is m
```

- object destructuring to extract some properties from object into scope
- declares and initializes variable for each property, re-assigns if already declared
- since strongly typed no empty values, no default values necessary

```
person is [ name, age ] mutable
```

- beware: can't specify im-/mutable individually for each property ❗️
- beware: error if variable already declared immutable before, or if declares variable immutable and assigns later ❗️
- can use to override variables before, can use variables later to override
- object spreading to extract all properties from object into scope, e.g. default value
- similar to object destructuring

```
obj is ...
```

<!-- todo: should distinguish assignment of same identifier and changing the underlying value, e.g. object property? -->



## Assignment

- like declaration
- can assign only to mutable variable

```
7 is m
```

```js
m = 7
```

- expression, e.g. can assign it to yet another variable

```
5 is n is m
```
