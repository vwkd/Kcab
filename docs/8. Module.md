# Module


￼
## Introduction

- reusable function to run later
- independent scope, i.e. no outer scope, no closure, no hierarchy, etc.
- written in independent location, e.g. file, URL, etc.
- builds program out of reusable components, fully modular programming
- is encouraged to create module library, e.g. private local, shared on the Web, etc.
- IDE is encouraged to make creating local modules easier, e.g. less window switching, automatically import, hide imports, etc.
- beware: no nested functions, only atomic modules ❗️
<!-- todo: good idea? Pass variables down through arguments at call site... In object can't access properties... -->
- beware: no lambda functions, only IIFE ❗️
<!-- todo: good idea? -->



## Body

- top level is function body, no syntax needed
- async by default, make parallel programs easier not harder
- can opt-in to sync instead
- in body can only call sync functions

```
sync &{

}
```

<!-- todo: fix remove syntax for sync function body in top level -->
- `self` built-in variable, can use to call itself recursively



## Input

- single argument `in` built-in immutable variable
- for multiple inputs pass object
- can assign (properties of) `in` to variable(s) or use directly
- no order on arguments as multiple only using object, can pass any subset or superset, missing values are set to `None`, unused values are ignored, like in JavaScript
<!-- todo: good idea to allow sub-/superset with loose coupling -->
- convention to declare variables at beginning, but not necessary
<!-- todo: to find accepted arguments parser needs to find all mentions of `in` and catalog the extracted variables, how to check if constructs object earlier into variable and passes variable, too difficult? -->
<!-- todo: mandatory / optional arguments -->
- IDE is encouraged to show summary on hover over function name like argument names and types, return type
- can use default value using boolean comparison, no new syntax
- since strongly typed no empty values, no default values necessary
- no optional parameters, needs to pass all arguments
<!-- todo: variadic arguments, rest parameters? for arbitrarily many parameters, e.g. add, join, etc.
what would parameter become? List, object?
can use multiple, matches greedily (longest possible match), like in TypeScript variadic tuple types?
-->
- allows overload of same name with another function with arguments of different types
<!-- todo: good idea? -->
- beware: types of at least one argument must be disjoint (can't be superset of other), otherwise compiler would have multiple choices...
<!-- todo: enough to guarantee that choices for compiler are unambiguous? -->
- root module has no input



## Output

- return value is last value like in Rust, defaults to `None`
- optionally can assign to built-in `out` variable to return earlier, e.g. in a branch
- returns on first assignment to `out`
- if wants multiple outputs return object

```
in is name
if name {
  "Hello {name}!" is out
}
"Hello stranger!"
```

```js
name => {
  if (name) {
    return `Hello ${name}!`
  }
  return "Hello stranger!" 
}
```

- if single output can use automatically return of last expression

```￼
"Hello {name}!"
```

- beware: if doesn't return anything needs to put `None` at bottom, since implicitly returns last value ❗️
- root module output is not used, by convention return `None`



## Import

- load module, e.g. from local file, from remote network
- support future medium where code is stored, e.g. file, clipboard, URL, etc.
- beware: not necessarily file ❗️
- built-in async loading functions for different remote spaces, returns module, assign identifier to use, own  identifier to avoid namespace conflicts
- convention at beginning but can be anywhere, e.g. conditional import

```
"matrix://src/hello" to import_URL is hello
```

- beware: import itself can't have side effects since whole module is function body ❗️
- beware: if doesn't assign return value of loading function call to variable then can't use import ❗️
- beware: implementation detail to pre-load modules before running code, shouldn't influence language, e.g. pre-parse source code to find imports, figure out which imports are used (e.g. conditional imports), could either load every import and discard unused or load less and load additional later, etc. ❗️
- beware: detect circular import ❗️



## Default imports

<!-- todo: what is imported by default? e.g. built-in data type objects?
how is it determined? e.g. via a config, via version number? -->
