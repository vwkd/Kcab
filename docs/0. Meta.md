## Introduction

- everything is an expression
- a block is an IIFE without arguments
- everything is an object
- an object is a scope
- scalar types are objects
- no macros for intransparent code replacement, instead make functions easy enough to use
- async by default



## Versioning

- every system naturally evolves
- if a system isn't allowed to evolve, it must keep old things around and limit new things to work around the old
- this is bad
- a language is such a system and should be allowed to evolve
- therefore it must be able to change *without* backwards compatibility (!)
- therefore there needs to be an identifier denoting the version of the code
- a runtime then can check if it supports the version, if not it can throw an error prompting to up- or downgrade depending if the version number is higher or lower than the supported version(s)
- the version identifier is the only thing that can not change, it must be fully backwards compatible, because it must be able to tell any runtime what version it is
- therefore it can not be *in* the code because then it would *be* code and code is allowed to change
- it must be *on* the code, like metadata
- there isn't a great way to store data about data with the data
- for files the file name can be misused, e.g. file extension
- try to be future-compatible (!), not like today backwards-compatibile, backward is forward
