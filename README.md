# Kcab

A programming language where things are backwards.

One day it occurred to me, that the data I care about when reading code is always at the end of the line. For example

```
a.b.c.doSomething("interesting")
```

I wondered If reading would be quicker if code were mirrored horizontally

```
("interesting")doSomething.c.b.a
```

## Todo

- arrays and objects

ordered and unordered composite type, numbers and identifiers, support accessing elements from any direction forwards or backwards

- type annotation
- destructuring
