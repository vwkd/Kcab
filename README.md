# Sdrawkcab

A programming language where things are backwards.

Code is written like ordinary English text top-to-bottom left-to-right.



## History

One day it occurred to me, that the data I care about when reading code is always at the end of the line. For example

```
a.b.c.doSomething("interesting")
```

I wondered If reading would be quicker if code were mirrored horizontally

```
("interesting")doSomething.c.b.a
```



## Todo
