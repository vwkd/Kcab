# Sdrawkcab

A programming language that is forwards because it is backwards.



## What?

It turns syntax around that hasn't been turned around before. Currently it's just words. You can try it out in your head. Maybe someone that actually knows how to write programs can come up with an implementation. If I could write it it would be take much inspiration from Rust. It may just as well be transpiled to Rust and just serve as a better syntax.



## Why?

One day when reading code it occurred to me that reading code is hard.

```js
foo.bar.baz.sayHi("Jupiter")
```

Why is reading it so hard?

It is because the interesting part is only at the end preceeded by many uninteresting things in the beginning which you have to read first.

This led to the initial idea of flipping code around horizontally.

```js
("Jupiter")sayHi.baz.bar.foo
```

This seems strange at first because you're not used to it. But once you get used to it it is much easier to read because the interesting things are in the beginning of the line and the rest can be skipped easily.

Writing it down more things turned out to be easier to read when switched around. The language evolved into thinking more generally about better syntax that make the language easier to write and concepts that make it simpler.
