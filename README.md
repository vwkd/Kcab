A programming language where things are backwards.

One day it occurred to me, that the data I care about when reading code is always at the end. For example

```
a.b.c.doSomething("interesting")
```

I wondered what would happen if code were mirrored horizontally.

```
("interesting")doSomething.c.b.a
```
