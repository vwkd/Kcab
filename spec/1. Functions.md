# Functions



## Introduction

- a function is a piece of code that can run
- it's an expression, it has a value after it's run
- an empty function returns `None`



## Declaration

```
{
  <= "Hello world!"
} =: hello
```

- is an expression, can be assigned to variable
- return value is last value like in Rust
- can explicitly return earlier using `<=`, e.g. in a branch
<!-- todo: conflicts with import??? -->
- can be anonymous, without a variable assignment
- a block is just an anonymous function without arguments !!!
- each file is itself a big block, that has an expression, if imported from another file !!!

```js
const hello = str => { return `Hello world!` }
```

## Calling

```
=> hello
```

- points reader to place where the next code is

### Arguments

```
x, y => {
  x + y
} =: add

1, 2 => add
```

- arguments are not backwards, because needs to see first, like initial variable in loop
- multiple arguments by commas
- no parentheses

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y
}

add(1, 2)
```
