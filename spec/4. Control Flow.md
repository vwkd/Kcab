# Control Flow

## Branches

```
str ?= num {

} str ?= bool {

} {

}

- no keywords, just blocks
- an expression like in Rust, not a statement, can use like ternary operator in JS

```js
if (str == num) {

} else if str == bool {

} else {

}
```

## Loops

```
1 =:: i &-> {
  i ?= 2 { skip }

  5 ?= i { end }

  1, i -> add @ Numbers
}
```

- like anonymous function that is executed multiple times
<!-- todo: wait until finds good syntax for anonymous function then make use just repeated function call -->
- conditions inside loop, can put wherever wants, allows to make `while`, `do while`, and any loop
<!-- todo: reconsider, since hard to parse, hard to read, easy to screw up when modifying, etc. -->
- `end` to break, `skip` to skip next iteration
- has complete code block do fancy stuff to initialise i
- also expression, value is last value

```js
for (let i = 1; i += 1; i == 5) {
  console.log(i);
}
```
