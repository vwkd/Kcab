# Control Flow



## Branches

```
str ?= num {

} str ?= bool {

} {

}
```

- conditional block
- an expression, like in Rust, can use like ternary operator in JS

```js
if (str == num) {

} else if str == bool {

} else {

}
```



## Loops

```
1 ->& i ->: {
  2 ?= i { skip }
  i -> print

  5 ?= i { end }
  1, i -> add @ Numbers
}
```

- repeated IIFE (not quite a block because arguments)
- an expression, like in Rust
- `->&` to denote it's executed multiple times
- needs to make own conditions within loop, can do whereever and whatever wants, e.g. `while`, `do while`, any loop, etc.
<!-- todo: reconsider, since hard to parse, hard to read, easy to screw up when modifying, etc. -->
- `end` to break, `skip` to skip next iteration in simple branch
- since IIFE can pass multiple arguments

```js
for (let i = 1; i += 1; i == 5) {
  if (i == 2) {
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}
```

- without arguments

```
->& {

}
```

```js
for (; ;) {
  
}

while (true) {
  
}
```
