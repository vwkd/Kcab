# Control Flow



## Branches

```
str ?= num {

} str ?= bool {

} {

}
```

- conditional execution of a block
- an expression, like in Rust, can use like ternary operator in JS

```js
if (str == num) {

} else if str == bool {

} else {

}
```



## Loops

```
1 -> i ->: {
  2 ?= i { skip }
  i -> print

  5 ?= i { end }
  1, i -> add @ Numbers
}&
```

- repeated execution of block
- an expression, like in Rust
- `&` after block to denote it's executed again
- conditions inside loop, can put wherever wants, allows to make `while`, `do while`, and any loop
<!-- todo: reconsider, since hard to parse, hard to read, easy to screw up when modifying, etc. -->
- `end` to break, `skip` to skip next iteration in simple branch
<!-- - has complete code block do fancy stuff to initialise i -->

```js
for (let i = 1; i += 1; i == 5) {
  if (i == 2) {
    continue
  }
  console.log(i)
}
```
