# Variables

## Variable Declaration

```
5 =: num
"cool" =:: str
false =: bool
```

- no keywords, just the operators `=:` and `>`
- immutable by default similar to Rust, operator `=::` for mutability
- must initialise, can use `null` value

```js
const num = 5
let str = "cool"
const bool = false
```

## Variable Assignment

```
"cooler" > str
```

- `>`, `+>`, `->`, `*>`, `/>`, `%>`, `^>`
- like in JS, just `=` replaced with `>`

```js
str = "cooler"
```

## Comparison

- `?=`, `?!=`, `?>`, `?<`, `?>=`, `?<=`
- prefix with `?`, only single `=`
- exact equality, no coercion or magic, transitive

## Logic

- `&`, `|`

## Arithmetic

- `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`
- like in JS, except `^`

## Other

- `()` to group
