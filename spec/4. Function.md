# Function



## Introduction

- unit program, transforms inputs to outputs
- can run later as reusable or run now as single use
- has own scope
- inherits scope of parent where is declared (not where is called), uses closure
- expression, can be assigned to variable, given as argument to other functions, first-class, etc.
- no macros, just functions
- tail call optimisation
- input like output is single value
- control flow construct, e.g. like conditional, loop (here identical), block (here identical), etc.
- beware: not a data type ❗️
- beware: completely different from object, unlike JavaScript where functions can have properties, and objects can be called ❗️
- beware: a function and object couldn't be identical, otherwise modifying the properties before calling it would result in different behavior since the variables in the scope would have changed ❗️



## Declaration

- reusable function to run later
- `&` to specify is reference to code, need to distinguish it from block

```
&{
  in is name
  "Hello {name}!"
} is hello
```

```js
const hello = name => { 
  return `Hello ${name}!`
}
```

- single argument `in` built-in immutable variable
- for multiple inputs pass object
- can assign (properties of) `in` to variable(s) or use directly
- no order on arguments as multiple only using object, can pass any subset or superset, missing values are set to `None`, unused values are ignored, like in JavaScript
<!-- todo: good idea to allow sub-/superset with loose coupling -->
- convention to declare variables at beginning, but not necessary
<!-- todo: to find accepted arguments parser needs to find all mentions of `in` and catalog the extracted variables, how to check if constructs object earlier into variable and passes variable, too difficult? -->
<!-- todo: mandatory / optional arguments -->
- IDE is encouraged to show summary on hover over function name like argument names and types, return type
- can use default value using boolean comparison, no new syntax
- since strongly typed no empty values, no default values necessary
- expression, can be assigned to variable, no declaration
- has its own scope closing over outer scope
- return value is last value like in Rust, defaults to `None`
- optionally can use `out` to return earlier, e.g. in a branch
- if wants multiple outputs return object

```
&{
  in is name
  if name {
    "Hello {name}!" out
  }
  "Hello stranger!"
} is hello
```

```js
const hello = name => {
  if (name) {
    return `Hello ${name}!`
  }
  return "Hello stranger!" 
}
```

- no optional parameters, needs to pass all arguments
<!-- todo: variadic arguments, rest parameters? for arbitrarily many parameters, e.g. add, join, etc.
what would parameter become? List, object?
can use multiple, matches greedily (longest possible match), like in TypeScript variadic tuple types?
-->
- allows overload of same name with another function with arguments of different types
<!-- todo: good idea? -->
- beware: types of at least one argument must be disjoint (can't be superset of other), otherwise compiler would have multiple choices...
<!-- todo: enough to guarantee that choices for compiler are unambiguous? -->



## Calling

- operator `to`, like pointing the reader to the place where needs to continue reading
- pass-by-value, like Rust


- with arguments

```
myvar to hello
```

```js
hello(myvar)
```

```
"Jupiter" to hello
```

```js
hello("Jupiter")
```

- IDE is encouraged to autocomplete argument names in object
- chained calls not nested if doesn't need to chain into object properties

```
"Jupiter" to uppercase to hello
```

```js
hello(uppercase("Jupiter"))
```

- grouped due to object, no need for grouping operator 
- without arguments
<!-- todo: pass `None` explicitly `None to hello`? -->

```
to hello
```

```js
hello()
```

- strongly typed, object must match input type, no missing properties



## Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE)

- single-use function to run now, called once at declaration
- anonymous since never assigned to variable

```
"Jupiter" to &{
  in is name
  "Hello {name}!"
}
```

```js
((name) => {
  return `Hello ${name}!`
})("Jupiter")
```

- shorthand for no arguments to leave of `to &`
- also called "block"

```
{
  "Hello World!"
}
```

- beware: bare declaration `{..}` and extended identifier `to hello` call function, while extended declaration `&{..}` and bare identifier `hello` return function reference ❗️



## Loop

- none, use tail recursive function instead
- an expression
- gives all benefits of functions
- can do any loop that wants, e.g. loop on multiple arguments simultaneously, condition check at beginning, etc.
- no separate syntax

```
&{
  in is i
  if i ?< 10 {
    i to print
    i + 1 to loop
  }
} is loop

1 to loop
// 1, 2, ..., 9
```

```js
function loop(i) {
  if (i < 10) {
    console.log(i)
    loop(i + 1)
  }
}

loop(1);
// 1, 2, ..., 9

for (let i = 1; i < 10; i += 1) {
  console.log(i)
}
// 1, 2, ..., 9

let i = 1
while (i < 10) {
  console.log(i)
  i += 1
}
// 1, 2, ..., 9
```

- can do condition check at end

```js
function loop(i) {
  console.log(i)
  if (i < 10) {
    loop(i + 1)
  }
}

loop(1);
// 1, 2, ..., 10

// no such for loop or while loop that checks condition at end before increment
// can use do...while but increment comes before condition check
// therefore do check at beginning for previous iteration and start with one less

let i = 0;
do {
  i += 1
  console.log(i);
} while (i < 10)
// 1, 2, ..., 10
```

- can't use IIFE because anonymous expression has no identifier to refer to itself,  must declare function and call it separately
<!-- todo: needs `continue` and `break`? -->

```
{
  &{
    in is x
    to loop
  } is loop
}
```
