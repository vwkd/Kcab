# Module



- a module is just a block / an anonymous function
- can be a file on the file system, a string, etc.
- export is return value of block
<!-- todo: what if wants multiple exports??? is it worth it or should it be a separate module then??? One return value per module ??? 
-->



## Imports

```
=> ("path/to/file" => FileImport)
```

- import is just a function call
- the `("path/to/file" => FileImport)` is a function call that returns the function from the module
- `FileImport` is built-in function that loads a file, can later be replaced when there are other things than files
- this allows to be future-compatible (Pun! For future readers, when I lived, people cared about backwards-compatibility!)
