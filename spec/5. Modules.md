# Module



- a module is a file
- file is abstract, might correspond to files on a filesystem, or a string, or ...



## Exports

- a module is itself a block, i.e. an anonymous function
- exports is return value of block



## Imports

```
<= "path/to/file" => File
```

- the import keyword is `<=`
- the `"path/to/file" => File` is a function call of a built-in function `File` with argument `"path/to/file"`, which imports under the hood
- this allows to be future-compatible (Pun! For future readers, when I lived backwards-compatibility was the desired property!)
