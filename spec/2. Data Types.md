# Data Types



## Introduction

- data types are inherently human-centric: string for text, number for number, boolean for a bit
- there might be other data types in the future
<!-- todo: what is a data type??? How can make Kcab data type agnostic??? -->

## None

```
None
```

- this is the data type for no value
- it has only a single value
- better name than `null` or `undefined`

## Function

- this is the data type for a piece of code that can run






## Numbers

```
12
```

- as usual

## Strings

```
"Hello world!"
```

- as usual

### Interpolation

```
"Hello {str}"
```

- expression block, can do any computation in there
- over multiple lines


## Objects

also mirrored vertically

```
{
  "Hello World": str,
  5: num
} =: obj let

num < obj
```
