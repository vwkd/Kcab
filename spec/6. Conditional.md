# Conditional



## Introduction

- branches in code flow
- executes block on condition
- expression



## Boolean

- condition is boolean

```
:: bool
{

}
```

```rust
if bool {

}
```

- can make exhaustive, must give alternative
- syntax uses single `:` to make writing safe code "easier"

```
: bool
{

}
_
{

}
```

```rust
if bool {

} else {

}
```

- can chain, i.e. first condition that is true
- syntax such that second condition is like a new condition in the alternative

```
: bool1
{

}
_: bool2 {

}
_
{

}
```

```rust
if bool1 {

} else if bool2 {

} else {

}
```

- can use like ternary operator in JS, but has own scope

```
: isDay { "Good morning" } _ { "Good night" } =: greeting
```

```js
const greeting = isDay ? "Good morning" : "Good night"
```

- block can start/end in same or separate line

```
:: bool {

}

:: bool
{

}

:: bool { }
```



## Value

- condition is some value
- first value that matches
- values must be of same type

```
:: value
- val1
{

}
- val2
{

}
```

- can make exhaustive, must match some
- syntax uses single `:` to make writing safe code "easier"
<!-- todo: distinguishing "-" from "_" is hard on the eyes... -->

```
: value
- val1
{

}
- val2
{

}
_
{

}
```

```rust
match value {
  val1 => {

  }
  val2 => {

  }
  _ => {

  }
}
```

<!-- todo: specify condition on match arm as well? mixes boolean with value, just use exhaustive boolean instead? -->
- block can start/end in same or separate line

```
:: value
- val1 {

}

:: value
- val1
{

}

:: value
- val1 { }
```
