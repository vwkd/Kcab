# Conditional



## Introduction

- branches in code flow
- executes block on condition



## Boolean

- condition is boolean
- first condition that is true
- non-exhaustive, may be no condition, i.e. can omit "else"

```
- bool1
{

}
-. bool2 {

}
--
{

}
```

```js
if (bool1) {

} else if (bool2) {

} else {

}
```

- expression
- can use like ternary operator in JS, but has own scope

```
- isDay { "Good morning" } -- { "Good night" } =: greeting
```

```js
const greeting = isDay ? "Good morning" : "Good night"
```



## Value

- condition is any value
- first condition that matches
- exhaustive, must match some

```
value :
- val1
{

}
- val2
{

}
-.
{

}
```

```rust
match value {
  val1 => {

  }

  val2 => {

  }

  _ => {

  }
}
```

- expression
- quits after first match, no break
<!-- todo: specify condition on match arm as well? mixes boolean with value, just use exhaustive boolean instead? -->
