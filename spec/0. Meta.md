## Introduction

- beware: left and right are flipped compared to traditional programming language ❗️



## Motivation

- a language naturally evolves
- if it isn't allowed to evolve it must keep all mistakes and limit new features, both bad
- Kcab is allowed to evolve and change without backwards compatibility (!)
- therefore there needs to be an identifier denoting the version of the code
- a runtime then can check if it supports the version and otherwise throw an error prompting to up- or downgrade depending if the version number is higher or lower than the supported versions
- the version identifier is the only thing that can not change, it must be fully backwards compatible, because it must be able to tell any runtime what version it is
- therefore it can not be *in* the code itself because then it would be code and code is allowed to change
- it must be *on* the code, currently probably the best way is the file extension in the file name



## Principles

- be inspired by math
- try to not be contrained by the current qwerty keyboard
- don't constrain readability for typeability, since editor can autocomplete
- try to be future-compatible (!), not like today backwards-compatibility, backward is forward
- don't use keywords, use syntax, because can't use keywords for identifiers anymore



## Key features

- everything is an expression
- a block is an IIFE without arguments
- everything is an Object
- an Object is a scope
- Scalar Types are objects
