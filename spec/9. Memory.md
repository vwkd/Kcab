# Memory



## Introduction

- compiled, no runtime
- memory management, no garbage collection
- like Rust, but pass-by-reference for all values



## Fundamentals

- variable exists on stack
- value of primitive type is "directly" on stack
- value of complex type only points to actual value on heap
<!-- todo: clarify, don't confuse with pointer / references -->
- passing value (e.g. assigning variable to another variable, passing variable to function) can reuse same data in memory ("pass-by-reference") or create copy ("pass-by-value")
- by default passing value does shallow copy, i.e. pass-by-value for stack value, pass-by-reference for heap value
- here choose to pass-by-reference everything
<!-- todo: good idea? -->
- beware: differs from Rust, where pass-by-value for stack value ❗️



## Ownership

- a value in memory is owned by a variable
- every value in memory has one and only one owner at a time
- frees when last owner goes out of scope
- passing a value changes its owner ("move"), previous variable can't access it anymore



## Borrow

- reference / pointer to other variable
- can borrow value instead of moving it
using borrow operator
- references are immutable by default like variables
- can have only one mutable reference or multiple immutable references in a scope

<!-- todo: borrow operator -->



## Copy

- can pass-by-value
- using copy operator

<!-- todo: copy operator -->
