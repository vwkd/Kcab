# Memory



## Introduction

- like Rust, but pass-by-reference for all values by default
- allocates memory, frees when last owner goes out of scope, no garbage collection
- every data in memory has one and only one owner at a time
- assigning variable to another variable or passing to function can reuse same data in memory ("pass-by-reference") or create copy ("pass-by-value")
- here defaults to pass-by-reference
- beware: differs from Rust, where defaults to pass-by-value for stack memory ❗️
- move changes owner of data, previous variable can't access it anymore
- can borrow instead using borrow operator
- multiple borrows if immutable, single borrow if mutable, at any given time
- can pass-by-value instead using copy operator
