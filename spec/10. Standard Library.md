## Introduction

- useful user-land utilities



## Compound Types

- "value" is collection of multiple scalar values
- `new` method that returns new value object
- value object has methods to set the scalar values
<!-- todo: auto-import compound types? -->

### List

```
to new of List is mylist
("John", "Jim", "Jill") to add of mylist
1 to get of mylist
2 to delete of mylist
```

- list of values
- data type object `List`
- not unique, i.e. duplicate insertions are allowed
- ordered by order of insertion
- deletion shifts index accordingly, i.e. no gaps
- exposes index, offers `get` method
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. size, isEmpty, each, has, etc.

```js
const mylist = ["John", "Jim", "Jill"]
mylist[1]
// no straightforward way to delete in JS
```

### Set

```
to new of Set is myset
("John", "Jim", "Jill") to add of myset
"Jim" to delete of myset
```

- set of values
- data type object `Set`
- unique, i.e. duplicate insertions are ignored
- ordered by order of insertion
- deletion shifts index accordingly
- doesn't expose index, no `get` method
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. size, isEmpty, each, has, etc.

```js
const myset = new Set();
myset.add("John")
myset.add("Jim")
myset.add("Jill")
myset.delete("Jim")
```



## Id

- object that generates unique IDs
- can generate unique ID using `new` method

```
to new of Id is id
```

```js
const id = Symbol();
```

- can generate unique ID with identifier
- gets ID for identifier or creates new one if none exists using `get` method

```
"identifier" to get of Id is gid
```

```js
const gid = Symbol.for("identifier")
```
