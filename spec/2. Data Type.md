# Data Type



## Introduction

- set of values
- mutually exclusive



## Motivation

- a value is data
- data is transformed, computer transforms input data to output data
- values flow through program, like water in a river
- data isn't fundamental, depends on goals of programmer
- hence values and hence data types aren't fundamental
- today needs strings, numbers, booleans
- in future might want other data types
- therefore provide only a single data type
- object is this most fundamental and only data type
- every value is of data type object
- beware: needs still special syntax for scalar data types ❗️



## Object

- a scope, maps identifiers to values, key-value map
- properties are *own* variables of scope (not from parent scope)
- beware: completely different from object, unlike JavaScript where functions can have properties, and objects can be called ❗️

### Creation

```
[
  42 is n
] is myobj
```

```js
const myobj = {
  n: 42,
}
```

- like block, except implicitly returns its scope instead of a value, no manual return, no arguments
- allows for arbitrary code between variables, like in block
- methods aren't special, just variables that hold functions
- can access own properties in method without need for `this`, because are just variables in inherited outer scope

```
[
  "Jupiter" is name
  &{
    "Hi, my name is {name}."
  } is sayHi
] is myobj
```

```js
const myobj = {
  name: "Jupiter",
  sayHi: function () {
    return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}.`
    }
}
```

- beware: for multiple values is mandatory new line as is line terminator even if brackets don't ❗️

```
[ "Jupiter" is name
  42 is age ] is person
```

```js
const person = { name: "Jupiter", age: 42 }
```

- if only declares properties can write on single line using commas and shorthand if variable already exists, i.e. no arbitrary code, other multi-line syntax like methods, etc.

```
"Jupiter" is name

[ name, 42 is age ]
```

```js
const name = "Jupiter"

{ name, age: 42 }
```

### Accessing

```
myvar of myobj
```

```js
myobj.myvar
```

- can set a property only if declared it mutable, else is frozen
- beware: mutability of object variable itself is separate from mutability of properties, mutable variable can change to different object but doesn't determine if object itself can change
<!-- todo: good idea? Rust doesn't differentiate between mutating same object and changing variable to new object -->
- can't add new properties or delete existing ones, needs to create new object, see Inheritance
- method using object properties still works after being extracted, because inherited outer scope

```
sayHi of myobj is extractedSayHi
to extractedSayHi to print
// "Hi, my name is Jupiter."
```

```js
const extractedSayHi = myobj.sayHi
console.log(extractedSayHi())
// "TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of undefined" in strict mode
// "Hi, my name is undefined." in non-strict mode
```

- no private properties, instead use block

```
&{
  "Jupiter" is name

  [
    &{
      "Hi, my name is {name}."
    } is sayHi
  ]
} is myobj
```

```js
const myobj = (() => {
  const name = "Jupiter";

  return {
    sayHi: function () {
      return `Hi, my name is ${name}.`
    }
  }
})()
```

- computed keys using block returning variable

```
{person} of group
```

```js
group[person]
```

### Method chaining

- method that returns another object
- don't use here because is backwards (!)
- flow of value is right-to-left instead of with reading direction from left-to-right
- needs nesting using grouping operator
- i.e. all just opposite of traditional language, here method chaining is nested and backwards, there function chaining is nested and backwards

```
print to each of (to sort (5 to first of list))
```

```js
list.first(5).sort().each(print)
```

- instead use (top-level) function chaining

```
list to firstFive to sort to print
```

### Classes

- none
- instead use factory function that creates object

```
&{
  name of in is name
  [
    name is name
    &{
      "Hi, my name is {name}."
    } is sayHi
  ]
} is Person

"Jupiter" to Person is myobj
```

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name,
    sayHi: function () {
      return `Hi, my name is ${this.name}.`
    }
  }
}

const myobj = Person("Jupiter");
```

### Inheritance

- none, like in Rust
- instead compose existing object
- can use some properties by declaring manually

```
[
  "Jupiter" is name
  25 is age
] is p1

[
  name of p1 is name
] is p1_part
```

```js
const p1 = {
  name: "Jupiter",
  age: 25,
}

const p1_part = {
  name: p1.name
}
```

- can use all properties by spreading out, e.g. default properties

```
[
  "John Doe" is name
  25 is age
] is person

[
  "Jupiter" is name
  person is ...
] is p1
```

```js
const person = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 25,
}

const p1 = {
  ...person,
  name: "Jupiter"
}
```

- spread at beginning uses all declarations from object, can't override using own declarations because repeated declaration throws
- spread at end only uses declarations from object for which doesn't already have own declaration
- works well with factories

```
&{
  name of in is name
  [
    name is name
  ]
} is Person

&{
  name of in is name
  id of in is id
  [
    name to Person is ...
    id is id
  ]
} is Employee
```

```js
function Person(name) {
  return {
    name: name
  }
}

function Employee(name, id) {
  return {
    ...Person(name),
    id: id
  }
}
```



## Custom Data Type

<!-- todo: revise since deleted "values are variables" concept -->

- object
- with methods for operators, see Operators
- with `new` method that returns new value object

```
1, 2 to new of Rational is one_half
```

- properties must be immutable such that can't overwrite
- to customise existing data type create new custom data type and inherit, see Inheritance
- name of data type object is by convention UpperCamelCase



## Scalar Types / Primitive Types

- "value" is single value
<!-- todo: how do types work under the hood?
 All except None and Boolean on heap since able to grow? -->
- can think of language creating infinitely many variables, e.g. `... to new of Number is 42`, although breaks down because
  - argument is undefined before creating the variable, circular
  - some identifier would be illegal, e.g. multiple numbers can be same, string can contain white space, etc.
- fundamental, needs to do anything useful
<!-- todo: no way to make object single data type syntactically as well? -->

### None

```
none
```

- "no value" value, single value
- object `None`
- better name than `null` or `undefined`

### Number

```
42
```

- real number values, infinitely many values
- data type object `Number`
- no integer, float, double etc. types
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. size, isInfinity, etc.

### String

```
"Hello world!"
```

<!-- todo: how to escape quotes? -->
- text values, infinitely many values
- data type object `String`
- no char type, because there is no digit type for numbers either
- supports any character including line breaks, i.e. multi-line string
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. `size`, `isEmpty`, `each`, `contains, `startsWith`, `endsWith`, etc.
- string interpolation using block, can contain arbitrary code

```
"Hello {name}"
```

### Boolean

```
true
```

- bit values, two values
- object `Boolean`
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. isTrue, isFalse, etc.



## Compound Types

- "value" is collection of multiple scalar values
- `new` method that returns new value object
- value object has methods to set the scalar values
- import from standard library
<!-- todo: auto-import compound types? -->
<!-- todo: how to import? Figure out Module Import first -->

### List

```
to new of List is mylist
("John", "Jim", "Jill") to add of mylist
1 to get of mylist
2 to delete of mylist
```

- list of values
- object `List`
- not unique, i.e. duplicate insertions are allowed
- ordered by order of insertion
- deletion shifts index accordingly, i.e. no gaps
- exposes index, offers `get` method
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. size, isEmpty, each, has, etc.

```js
const mylist = ["John", "Jim", "Jill"]
mylist[1]
// no straightforward way to delete in JS
```

### Set

```
to new of Set is myset
("John", "Jim", "Jill") to add of myset
"Jim" to delete of myset
```

- set of values
- object `Set`
- unique, i.e. duplicate insertions are ignored
- ordered by order of insertion
- deletion shifts index accordingly
- doesn't expose index, no `get` method
- many helper methods on data type object, e.g. size, isEmpty, each, has, etc.

```js
const myset = new Set();
myset.add("John")
myset.add("Jim")
myset.add("Jill")
myset.delete("Jim")
```
