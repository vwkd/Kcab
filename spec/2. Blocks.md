# Blocks



## Introduction

- a block is a piece of code that can run
- it's an expression, it has a value after it's run
- an empty block returns `None`
- also called "function"



## Declaration

```
{
  <= "Hello world!"
} =: hello
```

- is an expression, can be assigned to variable
- return value is last value like in Rust, defaults to `None`
- can explicitly return earlier using `<=`, e.g. in a branch

```js
const hello = str => { return `Hello world!` }
```

## Calling

```
=> hello
```

- like pointing reader to place where the code is

```js
hello()
```

### Arguments

```
x, y => {
  x + y
} =: add

1, 2 => add
```

- arguments are not backwards, because needs to see first, like initial variable in loop
- multiple arguments by commas

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y
}

add(1, 2)
```

## Immediately invoked anonymous block

```
=> {
  
}
```

- if it doesn't have any arguments, the `=>` can be omitted

```
{

}
```
