# Sequences



## Introduction

- sequence of values over time
- sequence can be infinite
- can think of as single changing value if time interval is small enough



## Puller

<!-- todo: does acutally need? No special language constructs that use it anyway. So any old `each` works just as well... -->
- changing value is pulled by consumer
- object with a `next` method that returns next value

```
-> next @ puller
```

```js
puller.next()
```

- has helper methods, e.g. `each`

```
handle -> each @ puller
```

```js
for (const val of puller) {
    handle(val)
}
```

- `next` value itself is object with properties

```
value @ next @ puller
done @ next @ puller
```

```
const { next, done } = puller.next()
```

- can also pass arguments to `next`
<!-- - built-in compound data types have `each` method that returns iterable??? -->



## Pusher

```
subscribe @ pusher -> handler =: unsubscribe
```

- changing value is pushed by producer
- traditionally called events, observables, etc.
- beware: doesn't use terminology like in JavaScript
- can subscribe handler using `subscribe` method
- returns `unsubscribe` function that can call

```js
eventTarget.addEventListener("someEvent", handler);
```
