# Data Types



## Introduction

- a data type is a set of values
- a value is data that is operated on ???????
- a computer transforms data, input to output
- values flow through program, like water in a river
- data is defined by operator and isn't fundamental, e.g. humans care about text or numbers
- therefore also values and hence data types are not fundamental
- in the future there might be other data types than text or numbers
- therefore the language should not data types for values, but a single data type that can adapt to any value
- call single data type "object", represents any other data type
- all data types here are just objects



## Object

- access value of property `a` on object `x`

```
a @ x
```

- properties that are functions are called methods

```
=> greet @ x
```

- can use function that returns object for object-oriented programming, no need for classes




## Standard Types

### None

```
None
```

- this is the data type for no value
- it has only a single value
- better name than `null` or `undefined`

## Numbers

```
12
```

- like a number

## Text

```
"Hello world!"
```

- like a string

### Interpolation

```
"Hello {str}"
```

- allows use of block, can do any computation in there like in function
- over multiple lines

## Bit

```
true
```

- like a boolean

## Block

```
{

}
```

- this is the data type for a piece of code that can run

## Set

```
(1, 2, false) =: set
1 => index @ set
```

- a list of values
- can access elements using position index to `index` method ``
- deletion shifts index of elements

```js
const list = [1, 2, false]
list[2] = 3
```

## Map

```
[a: true, 2: false] =: map
a => property @ map
false > (a => property @ map)

```

- a map of properties to values
- can access properties using property name

```
[a: "Hello", b: 5] =: map
6 > b @ map
```

```js
const map = [a: "Hello", b: 5]
map.a = 6
```
