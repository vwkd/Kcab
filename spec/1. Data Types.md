# Data Types



## Introduction

- a data type is a set of values
- a value is data that is operated on ???????
- a computer transforms data, input to output
- values flow through program, like water in a river
- data is defined by operator and isn't fundamental, e.g. humans care about text or numbers
- therefore also values and hence data types are not fundamental
- in the future there might be other data types than text or numbers
- therefore the language should not have data types for values, but a single data type that can adapt to any value
- call single data type "object", represents any other data type
- all data types here are just objects



## Objects

- access value of property `a` on object `x`

```
a @ x
```

- properties that are functions are called methods

```
-> greet @ x
```

- can use function that returns object for object-oriented programming, no need for classes




## Standard Types

### None

```
None
```

- this is the data type for no value
- it has only a single value
- better name than `null` or `undefined`

## Numbers

```
12
```

- like a number

## Text

```
"Hello world!"
```

- like a string

### Interpolation

```
"Hello {str}"
```

- allows use of block, can do any computation in there like in function
- over multiple lines

## Bit

```
true
```

- like a boolean

## Block

```
{

}
```

- this is the data type for a piece of code that can run

## Set

```
-> new @ Set =: s
"hello" -> set @ s
0 -> get @ s
"hello" -> has @ s
```


```
(1, 2, false) =: set
1 -> index @ set
```

- a list of values
- can access elements using position index to `index` method ``
- deletion shifts index of elements

```js
const s = new Set();
s.set("hello", "world")
// no s.get()
s.has("hello)
```

## Map

```
-> new @ Map =: m
"hello", "world" -> set @ m
"hello" -> get @ m
"hello" -> has @ m
```

- a map of properties to values

```js
const m = new Map();
m.set("hello", "world")
m.get("hello)
m.has("hello)
```
