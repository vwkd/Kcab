# Operator



## Introduction

- special function without sideeffects
- includes only few operators
- instead simply provides built-in functions
- might seem annoying, but
    - allows for custom operators
    - encourages custom operators instead of "misusing" an existing, e.g. `list -> isEmpty` instead of `list.length > 0` (JavaScript)
    - not limited by number of operands
    - simplifies lexing and parsing because less operators
- many built-in functions on objects
- names use letters because more expressive, though own function names can use unicode symbols, e.g. `+`
<!-- todo: should allow to import all functions from object, also import by default, via a config or simply version number, see Modules to figure out how to import/export -->
<!-- todo: consider if letter function names don't get too messy in chained operations -->
<!-- todo: include more operators like from Python or Elm, e.g. ++ to concatenate strings and arrays -->

- precedence:
    1. Function call
    2. ...



## Number

- none
- built-in methods on `Number` object: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `modulo`, `exponent`
 <!-- todo: what to use for field of composite data type??? -->



## String

- none
- built-in methods on `String` object: `add`
 <!-- todo: what to use for field of composite data type??? -->



## Boolean

- none
- built-in methods on `Boolean` object: `equal`, `unequal`, `greater`, `lesser`, `greaterorequal`, `lesserorequal`
- exact equality, no coercion magic, transitive
- built-in methods on `Boolean` object: `not`, `both`, `either`, `ifthen`, `iff`, `notboth`, `neithernor`, `butnot`
