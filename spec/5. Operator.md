# Operator



## Introduction

- function that transforms input in a very specific way
- includes only few operators
- instead simply provides built-in functions on data type objects
- allows for more operators because not limited by symbols
- allows for custom operators because object methods are user-level features
- names are more expressive, e.g. `list -> isEmpty` instead of `list.length == 0` (JavaScript)
- not limited by number of operands since just function call
- doesn't need all those precedence rules
- simplifies lexing and parsing because less operators
<!-- todo: consider if letter function names don't get too messy even in simple chained operations

```js
(2 + 3) * 4
```

by default

```
(2, 3 -> add @ Number), 4 -> multiply @ Number
```

after declaring top-level variables

```
(2, 3 -> add), 4 -> multiply
```

after declaring top-level variables with names of common symbols

```
(2, 3 -> +), 4 -> *
```

maybe after all does need functions that allow to declare prefix, infix, postfix?

## Declaration

```
=:
```

```
~:
```

- see Variable



## Assignment

```
~
```

- see Variable



## Grouping

```
()
```

<!-- todo: how to do nested operations, e.g. 5 + 3*2 - 2 -->
- precedence:
    1. Function call
    2. ...



## Data Type Operators

### Number

- none
- built-in methods on `Number` object: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `modulo`, `exponent`

### String

- none
- built-in methods on `String` object: `add`

### Boolean

- none
- built-in methods on `Boolean` object: `equal`, `unequal`, `greater`, `lesser`, `greaterorequal`, `lesserorequal`
- exact equality, no coercion magic, transitive
- built-in methods on `Boolean` object: `not`, `both`, `either`, `ifthen`, `iff`, `notboth`, `neithernor`, `butnot`

### Convenience

- methods on data type object
- can declare top-level variables to make them more convenient to use

```
add @ Number =: add
// ...
exponent @ Number =: exponent
```

- beware: don't spread out all properties of data type object, because has others that probably doesn't want, e.g. `all @ Number`
- built-in data type objects have `operators` property with object containing all operators
<!-- todo: consider more such objects with alternative names, e.g. `plus`, ..., `power`, etc. or `+`, ..., `^`, etc. -->

```
// somewhere internally within Number object
[
   add =: add
   // ...
   exponent =: exponent
] =: operators
```

- can spread `operators` object out to declare top-level variables

```
operators @ Number =: ...
```

```
all @ Number =: ...
operators @ Number =: ...

1, 2 -> add =: n
```
