# Operator



## Introduction

- functions with one or two parameters that are called prefix, infix, or postfix
- allows for custom operators because object methods are user-level features
<!-- todo: remove custom operators? -->
- allows for more operators because name not limited by symbols, e.g. `lt`, `+`, etc.
- provides built-in methods and corresponding operators on data type objects for most common operations
- encouraged to declare custom operators instead of using built-in to be more expressive, e.g. `list isEmpty` instead of `list.length == 0` (JavaScript)



## Declaration

- like function, but
- use special property of `in` that denotes argument position
<!-- todo: too much magic by simply using object property makes method and operator -->
- prefix or postfix if single positional argument

```
&{
  _right of in is a
  a to negate of Number
} is -
```

- infix if both positional arguments

```
&{
  _left of in is a
  _right of in is b
  a, b to add of Number
} is +
```

<!-- todo: shoud allow around-fix? like grouping operator? -->
<!-- todo: how to define precedence? or fixed by the type of operation, avoid requiring grouping to achieve correct semantics -->



## Calling

```
- n
```

```
n + m
```

- must use whitespace around operator name, otherwise would interpret it as single identifier which doesn't exist, e.g. `n+m`, `-n`
- to allowing no whitespace would need to forbid use of operator name in identifiers and semantics aware parsing



## Precedence

1. Property access

    - right-to-left associative

    ```
    size of name of person
    ```

2. Function call

    - left-to-right associative

    ```
    1 to negate to print
    ```

3. Postfix operation

    - left-to-right associative

    ?

4. Prefix operation

    - right-to-left associative

    ```
    + - 1
    - + 1
    ```

5. Infix operation

    - left-to-right associative for same type

    ```
    1 + 2 + 3
    1 ^ 2 ^ 3
    1 / 2 / 3
    1 % 2 % 3
    ```

    - otherwise grouping necessary

    ```
    1 + 2 * 3
    1 ?= 2 ?>= 3
    ```

6. Declaration, Assignment

    - left-to-right associative

    ```
    1 is n is m
    ```
    
    - beware: same syntax for four cases, where either variable is declared and assigned or re-assigned ❗️

<!-- todo: where is grouping, where is reference? -->



## Object property access

```
of
```

- see Object



## Variable Declaration

```
mutable
```

- see Variable



## Variable Assignment

```
is
```

- see Variable



## Reference

```
§
```

- can get reference of value
- references are first-class values, like in Rust
- allows to make pass-by-value and comparison-by-value



## Grouping

```
()
```

<!-- todo: use for tuple instead? fixed ordered sequence of values of any type. Could be similar to object -->



## Data Type Operators

- built-in methods on data type objects with words as names
- built-in operators built using these methods internally
- can declare top-level identifiers to make them more convenient to use

```
add of Number is add
+ of Number is +
```

- built-in data type objects have `operators` property with object containing all operators

```
// somewhere internally within Number object
[
  add is +
  // ...
  exponent is ^
] is operators
```

- can spread `operators` object to declare top-level identifiers

```
operators of Number is ...

n + m
```

### Number

- built-in methods and operators on `Number` object
- arithmetic methods: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `modulo`, `exponent`
- arithmetic operators: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`
- arithmetic assignment methods: `addOn`, `subtractOn`, `multiplyOn`, `divideOn`, `moduloOn`, `exponentOn`
- arithmetic assignment operators: `+is`, `-is`, `*is`, `/is`, `%is`, `^is`

### String

- built-in methods and operators on `String` object
- methods: `add`
- operators: `+`
- note, overload of same identifier as `+` of `Numbers` but with arguments of different type 

### Boolean

- built-in methods and operators on `Boolean` object
- comparison methods: `equal`, `unequal`, `greater`, `lesser`, `greaterorequal`, `lesserorequal`
- comparison operators: `?=`, `?!=`, `?>`, `?<`, `?>=`, `?<=`
- exact equality, no coercion magic, transitive, comparison-by-value, like Rust
- logical methods: `not`, `both`, `notboth`, `either`, `neithernor`, `ifthen`, `converse`, `iff`, `butnot`
- logical operators: `!`, `&`, `!&`, `|`, `!|`, `=>`, `<=`, `<=>`, `<!=>`
