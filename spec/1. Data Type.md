# Data Type



## Introduction

- set of values
- a value is data
- data is transformed, computer transforms input data to output data
- values flow through program, like water in a river
- data isn't fundamental, depends on goals of programmer, e.g. today humans might care about text
- hence values hence data types aren't fundamental
- in future might want new data types, might don't need old data types
- goal: have single data type that can hold any value
<!-- todo: is that even possible? -->



## Object

- collection of property-value pairs
- property accessor is `@` operator

```
-> greet @ x
```

- creates object by calling built-in `Object` function
- has methods to add, delete, properties, etc.
<!-- todo: how does prevent accidental use of internal properties, e.g. looping over properties? How allows to use "add" and "delete" for own properties? -->

```
-> Object =: myobj

"name", "Peter" -> add @ myobj
"age", 25 -> add @ myobj
"sayHi", {}
```

<!-- todo: how allows properties to reference other properties of self?
what happens after extraction, does loose reference to self?
-->

- can use function that returns object for object-oriented programming, no need for classes



## Standard Types

### None

```
None
```

- this is the data type for no value
- it has only a single value
- better name than `null` or `undefined`

## Numbers

```
12
```

- like a number

## Text

```
"Hello world!"
```

- like a string

### Interpolation

```
"Hello {str}"
```

- allows use of block, can do any computation in there like in function
- over multiple lines

## Bit

```
true
```

- like a boolean

## Block

```
{

}
```

- this is the data type for a piece of code that can run

## Set

```
-> new @ Set =: s
"hello" -> set @ s
0 -> get @ s
"hello" -> has @ s
```


```
(1, 2, false) =: set
1 -> index @ set
```

- a list of values
- can access elements using position index to `index` method ``
- deletion shifts index of elements

```js
const s = new Set();
s.set("hello", "world")
// no s.get()
s.has("hello)
```

## Map

```
-> new @ Map =: m
"hello", "world" -> set @ m
"hello" -> get @ m
"hello" -> has @ m
```

- a map of properties to values

```js
const m = new Map();
m.set("hello", "world")
m.get("hello)
m.has("hello)
```
