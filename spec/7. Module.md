# Module



## Introduction

- function without any outer scope
- top level is function body
- can accept arguments since is just function
- no global scope, only modules, must explicitly pass arguments
- can specify outputs and inputs



## Input

- public variables in top-level
- like arguments of function

```
in is name
```



## Output

- return value in top-level
- like return value of function
- multiple exports using object
- convention to always return object
- if single export and function declaration at bottom doesn't need object since automatically returns last expression

```￼
"Hello {name}!"
```

- beware: if doesn't return anything needs to put `None` at bottom, since implicitly returns last value ❗️



## Import

- calls built-in loading function to get module, e.g. string, clipboard, a file on the file system, a file at a URL, etc.

```
"src/mod" to import_file is hello
```

- beware: if doesn't assign return value of loading function call to variable then can't use import, only side effects
- calls module like function
- always returns single value since is function

```
"Jupiter" to hello
```



## Default imports

<!-- todo: what is imported by default? e.g. built-in data type objects?
how is it determined? e.g. via a config, via version number? -->
