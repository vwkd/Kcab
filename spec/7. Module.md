# Module



## Introduction

- function without any outer scope
- top level is function body
- can accept arguments since is just function
- no global scope, only modules, must explicitly pass arguments
- can specify outputs and inputs



## Input

- public variables in top-level
- like arguments of function

```
in is name
```



## Output

- return value in top-level
- like return value of function
- multiple exports using object
- convention to always return object
- if single export and function declaration at bottom doesn't need object since automatically returns last expression

```￼
"Hello {name}!"
```

- beware: if doesn't return anything needs to put `None` at bottom, since implicitly returns last value ❗️



## Import

- calls built-in loading function to get module, e.g. string, clipboard, a file on the file system, a file at a URL, etc.
- loading function is async

```
"src/mod" to import_file is hello
```

- beware: if doesn't assign return value of loading function call to variable then can't use import, only side effects ❗️
- calls module like function
- always returns single value since is function

```
"Jupiter" to hello
```

- beware: implementation detail to pre-load modules before running code, shouldn't influence language, e.g. pre-parse source code to find imports, figure out which imports are used (e.g. conditional imports), could either load every import and discard unused or load less and load additional later, etc. ❗️



## Default imports

<!-- todo: what is imported by default? e.g. built-in data type objects?
how is it determined? e.g. via a config, via version number? -->
