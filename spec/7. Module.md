# Module



## Introduction

- function without surrounding scope
- can be anywhere, e.g. in a single file on the file system, a string, clipboard, etc.
- module can accept arguments since is just function
- no global scope, only modules, must pass explicitly as arguments



## Exports

- export is return value of block
- to export multiple things needs to use object with properties
- convention is to always use an object



## Imports

<!-- todo: how to do import without relying on data type? what are top-level functions? -->

```
("path/to/file" to import_from_file) as module
someArgument to module as import
```

- import is function call
- always has single value since is single return value of function
<!-- todo: how to import only some properties from object? -->
- call built-in function to load module, e.g. `import_from_file` from a file, `import_from_URL` from URL, etc.
- allows loading module from other places, e.g. `import_from_clipboard`, etc.
- beware: if doesn't assign return value of function call to variable then can't use import, only side effects



## Default imports

<!-- todo: what is imported by default? e.g. built-in data type objects?
how is it determined? e.g. via a config, via version number? -->
