# Module



## Introduction

- function without surrounding scope
- in a single file, can be on the file system, a string, etc.
- module can accept arguments since is just function
- no global scope, only modules, must pass explicitly as arguments



## Exports

- export is return value of block
- if wants to export multiple things puts it on one object



## Imports

```
-> ("path/to/file" -> FileImport) =: o
```

- import is just a function call
- always has single value since is single return value of function
- calls built-in function to load module, e.g. `FileImport` from a file, `URLImport` from URL, etc.
- might seem annoying but keeps possibility open for future to import modules from new places, e.g. `ClipboardImport`, etc.
