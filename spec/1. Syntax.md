```

"Hello"
true, false
```

- line terminator is new line instead of semicolon, i.e. object must be written in multiple lines
<!-- todo: where allows line breaks and where not?
what if a line gets long? Just let editor wrap lines? -->
beware: adding / removing new lines may change semantics, just like adding / removing semicolons would ❗️
- `//` anywhere for single-line or rest-of-line comment
- `/* */` anywhere for in-line or multi-line comment
- IDE is encouraged to hide comments by default, show them on hover/tap, autocomplete, etc.
- identifiers can be any Unicode character not used by language, e.g. `+`, etc.
<!-- todo: what about space, tab, etc? What are undesired Unicode characters?
needs to use snake_Case?
-->
- multi-line syntax can start/end in same or separate line, e.g. `[ .. ]`, `{ .. }`, etc.
