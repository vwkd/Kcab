# Syntax



## Introduction

```
//, /*, */, =:, ~:, ~, (), ->:, ->, {}, [], ?, !, #, space, newline
```

- new line is used as line terminator, no semicolons, i.e. object must be written in multiple lines
<!-- todo: what if lines get too long? Just visually wrap in editor or allow multiple lines? -->
- `//` at beginning of line for single-line comment
- `/* */` anywhere for in-line or multi-line comment
- IDE is encouraged to hide comments by default, show them on hover/tap, autocomplete, etc.
- identifiers can be any Unicode character not used by language, e.g. `42`, `"Peter"`, `+`, etc.
<!-- todo: what about space, tab, etc? What are undesired Unicode characters? -->
