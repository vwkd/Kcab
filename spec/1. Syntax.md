# Syntax



## Introduction

```
//, /*, */, as, as mut, is, (), of, to, back, {}, [], :, ::, :., #, space, newline, in
```

```
none
42, 42.1, 42e1, -42
"Hello"
true, false
```

- new line is used as line terminator instead of semicolons, i.e. object must be written in multiple lines
<!-- todo: what if lines get too long? How to allow multiple lines without new line? Just let editor wrap lines? -->
beware: adding / removing new lines may change semantics, just like adding / removing semicolons would ❗️
- `//` at beginning of line for single-line comment
- `/* */` anywhere for in-line or multi-line comment
- IDE is encouraged to hide comments by default, show them on hover/tap, autocomplete, etc.
- identifiers can be any Unicode character not used by language, e.g. `+`, etc.
<!-- todo: what about space, tab, etc? What are undesired Unicode characters?
needs to use snake_Case?
