# Syntax



## Introduction

- writing direction is top-to-bottom left-to-right like ordinary English text
- beware: content is flipped left-to-right compared to traditional programming language ❗️
- make language easily readable for humans, everything else can be solved by the machine, e.g. size, speed, etc.
- don't constrain readability for typeability, since editor can autocomplete
- don't constrain characters to qwerty keyboard
- avoid keywords as much as possible, because can't use keywords for identifiers anymore



## Syntax

```
//
/*
*/
is
mutable
to
in
out
&{}
{}
of
[]
if
maybe
else
()
,
#
<space>
<newline>
```

- identifiers can be any Unicode character not used by language, e.g. `+`, etc.
- beware: could simulate space using non-space characters, e.g. thin space, etc.
- IDE is encouraged to highlight syntax with colors
- line terminator is new line, no semicolon, i.e. object must be written in multiple lines
<!-- todo: where allows line breaks and where not? what if a line gets long? Just let editor wrap lines? -->
- beware: adding / removing new lines may change semantics, just like adding / removing semicolons would ❗️
- `//` anywhere for single-line or rest-of-line comment
- `/* */` anywhere for in-line or multi-line comment
- IDE is encouraged to hide comments by default, show them on hover/tap, autocomplete, etc.
- multi-line syntax can start/end in same or separate line, e.g. `[ .. ]`, `{ .. }`, etc.
