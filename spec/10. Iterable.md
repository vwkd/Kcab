# Iterable



## Introduction

- sequence of values over time
- can think of as single changing value if time interval is small enough
- changing value is pulled by consumer
<!-- todo: find better name: puller? -->
<!-- todo: largely similar to JS -->



## Creation

- iterator is object with `next` method
- iterable is object that returns iterator in `new` method
<!-- todo: should force to use built-in object to build iterable?? e.g. `iterator -> new @ Iterable` -->
<!-- todo: can just make everything an iterable iterator? inherit a `new` and other helper methods? -->
- iterable has other helper methods, e.g. `iterate` method that iterates the iterator, instead of a `for...of` loop

```
print -> iterate @ counter
```

<!-- todo: how can chain helper methods, e.g. first, filter, map?
since values flow in reading direction from left-to-right behind the source, not before the source like the function calls and property accessors...

```js
counter.first(5).filter(isGreen).forEach(print)
```
-->
<!-- todo: part of the standard lib? -->
<!-- todo: can just create iterable iterator instead? needs to have the `new` method returning a new iterator -->



## Generator

- function with special syntax that creates iterable iterator
- looks like function that can pause and resume, pauses by returning some value, resumes when called again with new arguments
- same scope, instead of multiple normal functions with separate scopes
<!-- can every function be a generator where a normal function is just the limit where a generator has zero pauses and runs to completion? -->
