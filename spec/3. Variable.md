# Variable



## Introduction

- identifier for value within a scope
- lexical / static scope, not dynamic
- static type, not dynamic
- beware: left and right are flipped compared to traditional programming language ❗️



## Declaration

```
5 =: n
6 ~: m
```

- no keywords, just the operators `=:` and `~:`
- immutable by default similar to Rust, operator `~:` for mutability
- must initialise, can use `null` value

```js
const n = 5
let m = 6
```



## Assignment

```
7 ~ m
```

- operator `~` instead of `=`

```js
m = 7
```
