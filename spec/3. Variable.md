# Variable



## Introduction

- identifier for value within a scope
- lexical / static scope, not dynamic
- static type, not dynamic
- no global scope



## Declaration

- no syntax, like in Python
- mutable without initialization, e.g. in outer scope, initialize later in inner scope

```
n mutable
```

```js
let n
```

- beware: error if accessed before initialization ❗️
- mutable with initialization

```
5 is n mutable
```

```js
let n = 5
```

- immutable with initialization, default similar to Rust
- beware: no immutable without initialization, as would have no value ❗️

```
6 is m
```

```js
const m = 6
```

- no hoisting
- repeated declaration in same scope is error
- expression, e.g. can declare yet another variable

```
5 is n is m
```

- object destructuring

```
person is [ name, age ]
```

- since strongly typed no empty values, no default values necessary
- spread syntax declares variable for each property of object
- use to extract properties from object into scope
- only declares variables which aren't already declared, silently ignores already declared ones
- beware: because strongly typed knows exactly which variables get defined ❗️
<!-- todo: better allow overshadowing using own declaration instead? would be repeated declaration? -->

```
obj is ...
```

- name by convention lower_snake_case

<!-- todo: should distinguish assignment of same identifier and changing the underlying value, e.g. object property? -->



## Assignment

- like declaration
- can assign only to mutable variable

```
7 is m
```

```js
m = 7
```

- expression, e.g. can assign it to yet another variable

```
5 is n is m
```
