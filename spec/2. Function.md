# Function



## Introduction

- reusable piece of code with its own scope
- inherits scope of parent where is declared (not where is called)
- expression, can be assigned to variable, given as argument to other functions, etc.
- also called "block"
 


## Declaration

```
{
  "Hello world!" <-
} =: hello
```

- is an expression, can be assigned to variable
- has its own scope closing over outer scopet
- return value is last value like in Rust, defaults to `None`
- can explicitly return earlier using `<-`, e.g. in a branch

```js
const hello = str -> { return `Hello world!` }
```

## Calling

```
-> hello
```

- like pointing reader to place where the code is

```js
hello()
```

### Arguments

```
x, y -> {
  x + y
} =: add

1, 2 -> add
```

- arguments are not backwards, because needs to see first, like initial variable in loop
- multiple arguments by commas
<!-- todo: ?? maybe group operator for multiple arguments would look better, or [x, y] like a box with items that is shipped to function -->

```js
function add(x, y) {
  return x + y
}

add(1, 2)
```

## Immediately invoked anonymous block

```
-> {
  
}
```

<!-- todo: how to invoke with arguments and still declare them as parameters? -->
- if it doesn't have any arguments, the `->` can be omitted

```
{

}
```

```js
(function () => {
  // no args
})

(function (x, y) => {
  // args x, y
})(1, 2)
```



## Inheritance

- none
- can use functions which return objects
<!-- todo:
type annotation just needs to allow to specify something like `extend`, such that compiler can check if returned object implements all properties of returned object of another function
-->
