# Operators



## Introduction

- operators do operations on data types
- since data types are human-centric, so are operators
- for every operator there needs to be a different symbol
- this pollutes the global namespace
- in a functional language operators are simply functions

<!-- todo: consider if long operations don't get too messy in funciton notation -->

## Number

```
`x, y => OPERATION.Number
```

- operations `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`
<!-- todo: think about what symbols are legal, can use those symbols as name of operation or need to use text???
which symbols are really needed for the language???
find minimal set of symbols for language!!!
 -->
 <!-- todo: what to use for field of composite data type??? -->

- arithmetic

## Boolean

```
`x, y => OPERATION.Boolean
```

- for boolean data type `&`, `|`
<!-- todo: what else??? XOR, NOR? -->
- for any data type `?=`, `?!=`
- for number data type `?>`, `?<`, `?>=`, `?<=`
- prefix with `?`, only single `=`
- exact equality, no coercion or magic, transitive
