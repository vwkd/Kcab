# Variable



## Introduction

- identifier for value within a scope
- lexical / static scope, not dynamic
- static type, not dynamic
- no global scope



## Declaration

```
5 =: n
```

```js
const n = 5
```

- immutable by default, similar to Rust
- must initialise, use `null` value and mutable variable if needs to declare early
- no hoisting
- repeated declaration throws
- expression, e.g. can use to declare yet another variable

```
5 =: n =: m
```

- can declare mutable variable

```
6 ~: m
```

```js
let m = 6
```

- spread syntax declares variable for each property of object
- use to extract properties from object into scope
- beware: make sure properties on object don't have the same name as variables in outer scope, otherwise throws since repeated declaration

```
obj =: ...
```



## Assignment

```
7 ~ m
```

```js
m = 7
```

- can assign only to mutable variable
- expression, e.g. can assign it to yet another variable

```
5 ~ n ~ m
```
